# Pitch to for League of Legends World Championship 2020 Project
This repository is a pitch website to compel the product of live entertainment for an events company. 

I built it with Preact on top of the following libraries: 
* [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)
* [react-gsap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-gsap)
* [moment](https://momentjs.com/)
* [react-scrollmagic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scrollmagic)


## CLI Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test
```
